Here's a single README.md file that includes instructions for setting up both the backend and frontend components of the Read4UApp project:

# Read4UApp

Read4UApp is a project that consists of both backend and frontend components. The backend is developed using Node.js, and the frontend is developed using React.js.

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend server will start running at `http://localhost:5500`.

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend development server will start running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Accessing the Application

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the Read4UApp in your web browser:

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend: [http://localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500)

## Additional Notes

- Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- You may need to adjust the ports or configuration files based on your specific setup.
- Ensure that the backend server is running before starting the frontend development server.
